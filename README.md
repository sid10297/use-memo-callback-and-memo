# Learning React Optimization Hooks and Memoization

This repository serves as a learning sandbox for exploring the optimization hooks provided by React, including `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and the usage of `React.memo`.

## About
The code within this repository demonstrates practical examples and use cases for leveraging React's memoization techniques. Through simple components and scenarios, we aim to understand:

- **`useMemo`**: Exploring memoization of values to prevent unnecessary recalculations and improve performance.
- **`useCallback`**: Understanding the memoization of callback functions, optimizing component re-renders.
- **`React.memo`**: Demonstrating the memoization of functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders based on prop changes.

## Usage
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sid10297/use-memo-callback-and-memo.git
   cd learning-react-optimization-hooks
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):**
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Contributions
Contributions and suggestions for improvements are welcome! If you have insights, optimizations, or additional examples related to `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `React.memo`, feel free to open a pull request or create an issue.
